Turning to the tactical elements of Dorner 's rampage, John Miller -- CBS News senior correspondent and former head of the LAPD Major Crimes Division -- said the attacks likely took a "remarkable amount of pre-staging" and added that "somebody who put that much pre-staging planning into a series of events ... it's doubtful that they didn't put the same amount of planning into the end game ... It makes you wonder what his plan is for the end game." Bratton said he found it "very surprising that now with all this attention he has brought onto himself, he has not started to reach out to the media to exploit it ... it's very interesting that he has stayed quiet." Miller explained that Dorner "cut off all his cell phones and other connections" on Jan. 31 and Bratton said, " he 's aware that anything he uses electronically can be immediately zeroed in on so he 's possibly staying quiet because of that understanding.
